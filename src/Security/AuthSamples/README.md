## Building from source

To run a complete build on command line only, execute `build.cmd` or `build.sh` without arguments.

Before opening this project in Visual Studio or VS Code, execute `build.cmd /t:Restore` (Windows) or `./build.sh /t:Restore` (Linux/macOS).
This will execute only the part of the build script that downloads and initializes a few required build tools and packages.

See [developer documentation](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki) for more details.
